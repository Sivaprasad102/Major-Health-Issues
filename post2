<h1 id="content">What is Diabetes?</h1>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Diabetes is a chronic (long-lasting)&nbsp;health condition&nbsp;that affects how your body turns food into energy.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Your body breaks down most of the food you eat into sugar (glucose) and releases it into your bloodstream. When your blood sugar goes up, it signals your pancreas to release insulin. Insulin acts like a key to let the blood sugar into your body’s cells for use as energy.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With diabetes, your body doesn’t make enough insulin or can’t use it as well as it should. When there isn’t enough insulin or cells&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/basics/insulin-resistance.html">stop responding to insulin</a>, too much blood sugar stays in your bloodstream. Over time, that can cause serious health problems, such as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/library/features/diabetes-and-heart.html">heart disease</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/managing/diabetes-vision-loss.html">vision loss</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/managing/diabetes-kidney-disease.html">kidney disease</a>.</p>

<h2>Types of Diabetes</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are three main types of diabetes:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/basics/type1.html">type 1</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/basics/type2.html">type 2</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/basics/gestational.html">gestational diabetes</a>&nbsp;(diabetes while pregnant).</p>

<h3>Type 1 Diabetes</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Type 1 diabetes is thought to be caused by an autoimmune reaction (the body attacks itself by mistake). This reaction stops your body from making insulin. Approximately 5-10% of the people who have diabetes have type 1. Symptoms of type 1 diabetes often develop quickly. It’s usually diagnosed in children, teens, and young adults. If you have type 1 diabetes, you’ll need to take insulin every day to survive. Currently, no one knows how to prevent type 1 diabetes.</p>

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Symptoms and Risk Factors</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It can take months or years before&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/basics/symptoms.html">symptoms</a>&nbsp;of type 1 diabetes are noticed. Type 1 diabetes symptoms can develop in just a few weeks or months. Once symptoms appear, they can be severe.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Some type 1 diabetes symptoms are similar to symptoms of other health conditions. Don’t guess! If you think you could have type 1 diabetes, see your doctor to get your blood sugar tested. Untreated diabetes can lead to very serious—even fatal—health problems.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/basics/risk-factors.html">Risk factors</a>&nbsp;for type 1 diabetes are not as clear as for prediabetes and type 2 diabetes. However, studies show that family history plays a part.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Testing for Type 1 Diabetes</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/basics/getting-tested.html">simple blood test</a>&nbsp;will let you know if you have diabetes. If you were tested at a health fair or pharmacy, follow up at a clinic or doctor’s office. That way you’ll be sure the results are accurate.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If your doctor thinks you have type 1 diabetes, your blood may also be tested for autoantibodies. These substances indicate your body is attacking itself and are often found with type 1 diabetes but not with type 2. You may have your urine tested for ketones too. Ketones are produced when your body burns fat for energy. Having ketones in your urine indicates you have type 1 diabetes instead of type 2.</p>

<h2>Managing Diabetes</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Unlike many health conditions, diabetes is&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/managing/index.html">managed</a>&nbsp;mostly by you, with support from your health care team:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Primary care doctor</li><li>Foot doctor</li><li>Dentist</li><li>Eye doctor</li><li>Registered dietitian nutritionist</li><li>Diabetes educator</li><li>Pharmacist</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Also ask your family, teachers, and other important people in your life for help and support. Managing diabetes can be challenging, but everything you do to improve your health is worth it!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you have type 1 diabetes, you’ll need to take insulin shots (or wear an insulin pump) every day. Insulin is needed to manage your blood sugar levels and give your body energy. You can’t take insulin as a pill. That’s because the acid in your stomach would destroy it before it could get into your bloodstream. Your doctor will work with you to figure out the most effective type and dosage of insulin for you.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You’ll also need to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/managing/managing-blood-sugar/bloodglucosemonitoring.html">do regular blood sugar checks</a>. Ask your doctor how often you should check it and what your target blood sugar levels should be. Keeping your blood sugar levels as close to target as possible will help you prevent or delay diabetes-related&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/managing/problems.html">complications</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Stress is a part of life, but it can make managing diabetes harder. Both managing your blood sugar levels and dealing with daily diabetes care can be tougher to do. Regular physical activity, getting enough sleep, and exercises to relax can help. Talk to your doctor and diabetes educator about these and other ways you can manage stress.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Healthy lifestyle habits are really important too:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Making&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/healthyweight/healthy_eating/index.html">healthy food choices</a></li><li>Being&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/library/features/get-moving-to-manage-diabetes.html">physically active</a></li><li>Controlling your&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bloodpressure/">blood pressure</a></li><li>Controlling your&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/cholesterol/index.htm">cholesterol</a></li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Make regular appointments with your health care team. They’ll help you stay on track with your treatment plan and offer new ideas and strategies if needed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<h3>Type 2 Diabetes</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With type 2 diabetes, your body doesn’t use insulin well and can’t keep blood sugar at normal levels. About 90-95% of people with diabetes have type 2. It develops over many years and is usually diagnosed in adults (but more and more in children, teens, and young adults). You may not notice any symptoms, so it’s important to get your blood sugar tested if you’re at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/basics/risk-factors.html">risk</a>. Type 2 diabetes can be prevented or delayed with healthy lifestyle changes, such as:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Losing weight.</li><li>Eating healthy food.</li><li>Being active.</li></ul>

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Symptoms and Risk Factors</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Type 2 diabetes&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/basics/symptoms.html">symptoms</a>&nbsp;often develop over several years and can go on for a long time without being noticed (sometimes there aren’t any noticeable symptoms at all). Because symptoms can be hard to spot, it’s important to know the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/basics/risk-factors.html">risk factors</a>&nbsp;and to see your doctor to get your blood sugar tested if you have any of them.</p>

<p>Unlike many health conditions, diabetes is managed mostly by you, with support from your health care team (including your primary care doctor, foot doctor, dentist, eye doctor, registered dietitian nutritionist, diabetes educator, and pharmacist), family, and other important people in your life. Managing diabetes can be challenging, but everything you do to improve your health is worth it!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You may be able to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/managing/index.html">manage your diabetes</a>&nbsp;with healthy eating and being active, or your doctor may prescribe insulin, other injectable medications, or oral diabetes medicines to help manage your blood sugar and avoid&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/managing/problems.html">complications</a>. You’ll still need to eat healthy and be active if you take insulin or other medicines. It’s also important to keep your&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bloodpressure/">blood pressure</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/cholesterol/index.htm">cholesterol</a>&nbsp;close to the targets your doctor sets for you and get necessary screening tests.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You’ll need to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/managing/managing-blood-sugar/bloodglucosemonitoring.html">check your blood sugar</a>&nbsp;regularly.
